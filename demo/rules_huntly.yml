# Basic isolation and residual pressure thresholds for Huntly demo site.
# Each section documents the default valve arrangement.
steam:
  isolation: DDBB    # Double block and bleed isolation for steam mains.
  bleed: true        # Bleed valve remains open to vent trapped steam.

condensate:
  isolation: single  # Single block adequate on condensate return lines.
  drain: true        # Drain valve ensures line can be emptied.

instrument_air:
  supply: block      # Block supply to stop backfeed during maintenance.

# kPa residual pressure thresholds considered safe after isolation.
residual_pressure:
  steam: 7           # Steam lines should be below 7 kPa.
  condensate: 3      # Condensate headers safe below 3 kPa.
  instrument_air: 1  # Instrument air must drop below 1 kPa.
