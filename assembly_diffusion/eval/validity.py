r"""Validation utilities for molecular graphs.

baseline: RDKit sanitization serves as the reference for chemical validity.
data_sources: molecular graphs generated by diffusion models and the RDKit
    toolkit for sanitization.
method: convert :class:`~assembly_diffusion.graph.MoleculeGraph` objects to
    RDKit molecules and attempt sanitization, returning ``None`` on failure.
metrics: validity rate ``V`` computed from ``N`` generated graphs ``g_i`` as

    .. math::

        V = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{1}[\text{sanitize}(g_i)]

    where ``sanitize`` indicates successful RDKit sanitization.
objective: provide deterministic RDKit-based checks to assess whether
    generated molecules obey valency and charge rules.
report: for experiments with multiple random seeds ``s``, compute ``V`` for
    each seed and report ``mean Â± std`` over ``s``.
params: none.
repro: given the same graph and RDKit version, sanitization results are
    deterministic, ensuring reproducible validity evaluation.
