"""Experiment specification for training the assembly-index surrogate model.

baseline: a mean-value predictor establishes the performance to surpass.
data_sources: molecular descriptors and assembly indices loaded from
    ``qm9_chon_ai.csv`` provide features and labels.
method: read the dataset, train a PyTorch regression model with k-fold cross
    validation and save resulting metrics and artifacts.
validation: each fold uses an internal train/validation split with the model
    chosen by lowest validation mean absolute error (MAE).  Training halts
    early when the validation MAE fails to improve for a configured patience.
objective: learn a fast surrogate capable of approximating the exact assembly
    index computation.
params: model architecture, learning rate, random seed and number of folds
    control the training behaviour.
repro: running ``python scripts/train_surrogate.py`` writes ``cv_metrics.json``,
    ``model.pt`` and ``calibration_plot.png`` into a timestamped ``results``
    subdirectory.
validation: smoke tests such as ``tests/test_guidance.py`` ensure surrogate
    predictions integrate correctly with the diffusion pipeline.
